and traverse your React Components' output.

### Enzyme and React Testing Library---->

However, they have different approaches to testing.

### Enzyme---->

Is a DOM-based testing library. It allows you to access the internal workings of your components, including their state and props.
This can be useful for testing specific implementation details.However, it can also make your tests more brittle and difficult to maintain.

### React Testing Library---->,

On the other hand, is a component-based testing library.
It focuses on testing the behavior of your components, rather than their implementation details.
This makes your tests more robust and easier to maintain.

### Jest is a JavaScript testing framework---->

Designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase.
It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly. Jest is well-documented,
requires little configuration and can be extended to match your requirements.
